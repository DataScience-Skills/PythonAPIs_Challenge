## Analysis of Global Weather Patterns

### __The Story:__ We want to answer a question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?". This is answered by visualizing weather data from over 500 cities across the world and analyzing the relationship between weather variables and latitude. This information is used to plan vacations.

### Languages, Libraries & Tools Used:
- **Python:** Utilize Python programming language to handle data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Use Jupyter notebooks for code development, data exploration, and visualization.
- **citipy:** Utilize citipy to find the nearest city based on coordinates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Retrieve weather data for cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Geoapify API:** Utilize the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels for each city.
- **geoViews:** Create map visualizations of cities and hotels.
