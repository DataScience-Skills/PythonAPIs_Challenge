### __The Story:__
"Where should we go for vacation, and what is the weather like around the world?". To answer this question, we visualize weather data from over 500 cities across the world and analyze the relationship between weather variables and latitude. Will this help you decide where to go for vacation?

### Languages, Libraries & Tools Used:
- **Python:** Utilize Python programming language to handle data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Use Jupyter notebooks for code development, data exploration, and visualization.
- **citipy:** Utilize citipy to find the nearest city based on coordinates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Retrieve weather data for cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Geoapify API:** Utilize the Geoapify API to find nearby hotels for each city.
- **geoViews:** Create map visualizations of cities and hotels.

### In Conclusion:
Where to visit depends on what our vacation plans are; where we want to go, what we want to do, and who we want to see! Depending on a sample of potential vacation interests, this project suggests we visit these locations:
| __Interests__ | __Locations__ |
|------------|--------------|
| Beach | test-city-1, test-city-2 |
| Mountains | test-city-1, test-city-2 |
| Desert | test-city-1, test-city-2 |
| Windsurfing | test-city-1, test-city-2 |
| Camping | test-city-1, test-city-2 |
